# Shitpost Loudly

Voice out the best copypastas by using the most advanced of speech synthesis APIs, right here in your browser!  
(I also planned on doing Natural Language Processing because it's a new and exciting feature, but it broke)

# URLs

https://shitpostloudly.github.io/ - gets a random Reddit /r/copypasta shitpost. Probably NSFW. Sorry.

https://shitpostloudly.github.io/make-a-shitpost/ - pretty obvious

https://shitpostloudly.github.io/yt/VIDEO_ID - YouTube transcript shitposting. Replace VIDEO_ID with whatever video you have that has transcripts enabled. This feature is experimental and may break in the future.

https://shitpostloudly.github.io/r/SUBREDDIT_ID/POST_ID - Reddit shitposting. Replace SUBREDDIT_ID with `hearthstonecirclejerk` and POST_ID with `9h1o9j`. Also works if you just post the entire URL chain including the ``/comments/'' into it.

# Q&A

## What can you do with it?

Well, if you read the above, it does exactly as it says. It uses browser text-to-speech engines to play back the text that you give it.

It's pretty nifty at times. Not to mention none of this is costing me a cent.

## Haha nerd why did you waste your life on this stupid project

shut up your mouth haha

# Planned features

- Toggling the fallback speech API (it's pretty bad though)
