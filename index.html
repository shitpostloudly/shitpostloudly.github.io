<h1>Not only is finding the global optimum of a path given elevation data online illegal, online forums often come with "bonus" features in the form of nasty plagiarized code and academic integrity violations. Stay legal and stay safe, code it yourself or if you don't want to pay for tutors just get good, which is mostly compatible and also requires you to understand the code. Remember that there are cheaper alternatives like a Bachelors of Science which is an awesome deal as a commercially made Engineering degree can cost tens of thousands.</h1>
