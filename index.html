<h1>Not only is finding the global optimum of a path given elevation data online illegal, online forums often come with &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; features in the form of nasty plagiarized code and academic integrity violations. Stay legal and stay safe, code it yourself or if you don&rsquo;t want to pay for tutors just get good, which is mostly compatible and also requires you to understand the code. Remember that there are cheaper alternatives like a Bachelors of Science which is an awesome deal as a commercially made Engineering degree can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</h1>
